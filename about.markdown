<p align="justify">This article presents conclusions drawn from an analysis of assault, prostitution, and forcible sex offenses crime incidents reported in the San Francisco area. Data have been provided thanks to the SF OpenData project and include crime occurrences recorded between 2003 and 2022 (<a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry">2003-2018</a>/<a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">2018-2022</a>).

We present various visualizations concerning the distribution of those crimes over time and the location of the incidents to uncover patterns behind the data. We also cite various articles and reports to help justify what was observed during the analysis.

For clarification, below are the definitions of crimes:

Assault - generally defined as an intentional act that puts another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. No physical injury is required, but the actor must have intended to cause harmful or offensive contact with the victim and the victim must have thereby been put in immediate apprehension of such contact (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault_and_battery">Cornell</a>).


Prostitution - involves engaging, agreeing, or offering to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault_and_battery">Cornell</a>).

Forcible sex offense - any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent
